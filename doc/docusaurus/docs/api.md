The C++ classes are documented in the source code and may be visualized with
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html). To locally have the doxygen html
documentation, build `dune-copasi` [manually](install_use.md) and use the
`make doc` target in the build directory.

:::caution Work In Progress
Make the Doxygen documentation available online.
