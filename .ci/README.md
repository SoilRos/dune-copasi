## How this CI works?

We have 3 Continous Integration services: 
  - [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
  - [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
  - [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/)
The reason for this is because only one could not tackle all three platforms we want 
to reach. That is:
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows

Sice the last two CI are better ingegrated with GitHub, we have set a repository there which 
mirrors all modifications made in the main repository.

  - Main repository: https://gitlab.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi
  - Mirror repository: https://github.com/SoilRos/dune-copasi

The main idea here is that they almost the same instructions in the different stages.
In all the cases, the scripts expect to have defined `DUNECONTROL` and 
`DUNE_OPTIONS_FILE` variables for running `dunecontrol` and for the configuration 
options. 

### Stage: Setup

In this stage, we configure and install all the dependencies that `dune-copasi` requires.
In this case, Travis and Appveyor use the script [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) while gitlab uses 
the dependencies docker image in the container registry. The latter only updated for the 
`master` branch by the docker script [`dependencies.dockerfile`](../docker/dependencies.dockerfile).
This makes the GitLab CI run faster as all the dependencies are already installed.

### Stage: Build

This stage builds `dune-copasi` following the [`build.sh`](build.sh) script which in turs run the 
`dunecontrol` command for the project.
This stage always should be run.

### Stage: Unit Tests

<<<<<<< HEAD
This stage builds and runs the unit tests by running the [`unit_tests.sh`](unit_tests.sh) 
script. `ctests` runs all tests with the tag `unit`. This stage always should be run.

### Stage: System Tests

This stage runs all the system tests tagged with `DUNE_SYSTEMTEST` when running the 
[`system_tests.sh`](system_tests.sh) script. Since most of the system tests are 
generated by `dune-testools`, which is optional, this stage will only make 
sense when `dune-testools` is installed in the setup stage. Currently, this is 
not feasible for windows due to the python environment setup.
